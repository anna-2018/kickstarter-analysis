# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose of analysis was to show visual breakdowns of theater category outcomes by month and play subcategory outcomes based on funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis on 'Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date': the number of successful campaigns significantly increases in May and June; and significantly decreases in November and December. This conclusively shows that campaigns should be launched in summer months rather than winter months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: the most successful number of outcomes comes from goals with less than 5000. While the chart does show that there was a spike in successful campaigns in the 35000-45000 range, this is skewed since the number of campaigns is less than 10. The higher the Goal, the higher chance of a failed campaign.

### Biggest challege that was encountered was the COUNTIF function for the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' where the chart did not match up to the example screenshot shown. I found that I forgot to set nearly all the 'Goal' equations without an '='. So instead of '>= for 40000' it was only set at '>40000'. It just shows how important it is to set equations up correctly in the beginning otherwise the data can be completely different than expected.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#### 1. Time of year has no relation to whether a campaign failed.
#### 2. While the number of campaigns is higher in summer months, the number of successful ones is also significantly higher.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
#### The higher the goal amount, the greater chance of a failed campaign.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
#### Limitations to the charts created is they are still seen as high level. While it seems successful campaigns spike in summer months, that may be true in US and not the case in GB. It is important to understand all the factors in a spreadsheet when creating graphs and charts only highlighting certain items.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
#### Graphs and tables looking at successes/failures by country - it is important to see if only country has a majority of failures or successes to understand why that may be the case.
